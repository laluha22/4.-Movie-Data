# 4.-Movie-Data

I found this project extremely challenging and spent a very long time on it. I watched many tutorials on different types of DOM manipulation on YouTube and read so many guides online. I decided to use a table for my DOM manipulation to render the object onto the HTML page, as I thought that a table format works well for the movie data, especially when it comes to viewing ratings etc. Using arrays, I stored the object in a js file and used an EventListener function to display the table when the user clicks a button for some user interactivity. I used some funky styling to give the page some character and a fun vibe - it was a creative and relaxing process after hitting so many walls writing the script!

I also added an interactive element where users can input their own movie data and it displays as a table. I am still unsure if I understood the assignment correctly, but it was definitely a steep learning curve compared to the other projects!
